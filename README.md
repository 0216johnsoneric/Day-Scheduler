# Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows you to save your daily events for each hour of the day. Programmed using HTML and CSS powered by Javascript/jQuery.
Moment.js allows the user to know what Day it is that they are scheduling and implementing localStorage allows a user to save a text event in the timeblocks.
If and Else conditionals are used to dynamically let the user know what time of day they are entering a new text event either in the past, present, or future!
Enjoy your scheduling!
